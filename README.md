# Delaunay-Triangulation
Delaunay Triangulation is a triangulation technique given a set P of points in a plane such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle. In this code we have employed Voronoi Diagram as the basis for triangulation. For more infromation and applications of Delaunay Triangulation refer wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation

# Runnning the Code
For running the code include library from OGDF: http://www.ogdf.net/lib/exe/fetch.php/tech:ogdf.v2012.07.zip
